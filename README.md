# SP500-Direction-Prediction-News-Sentiment-Topic

This repository contains the code and results for my master thesis titled "Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis for Predicting the Direction of Movement of the S&P 500 Index Based on Financial News".

## Overview

In this project, I explored the use of topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques to predict the direction of movement of the S&P 500 Index based on financial news data.

## Contents

- `code/`: This directory contains the Python scripts used for data preprocessing, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and model training.
- `results/`: This directory contains the results of the analysis, including performance metrics, visualizations, and any other relevant outputs.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "All the News 2" news articles dataset, which can be found [here](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset). This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of news articles from various sources.

## Usage

To replicate the results of the thesis, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.
3. Use the topic modeling and sentiment analysis scripts to extract features from the text data.
4. Train and evaluate predictive models using the processed data.
5. Explore the results and visualizations in the `results/` directory.
